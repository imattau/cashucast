# CashuCast

## Development environment

Bootstrap the project on a fresh Linux machine by running:

```bash
./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
```

The script verifies Linux, installs Node.js 20, pnpm, Docker (with the compose plugin), and installs project dependencies using `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
